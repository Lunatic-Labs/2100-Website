# 2100-Website

This website is intended to advertise the upcoming game: 2100: The Second Wave.

The game is a post apocalyptic top down shooter based on the events that transpired during 2020.
The game is set in a dystopian universe where robots have taken over the world, and eliminated the 
majority of mankind in the process. A small team of specially trained individuals take it upon 
themselves to find a cure and end the robot reign. 

Can you survive the second wave?

This is not set in stone, and the website can be completely redone however you like, as long as it encapsulates the vibe of the game.
